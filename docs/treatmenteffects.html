<p>Statistics teachers oftentimes proudly declare to their students that correlation is not causation when emphasizing the idea that just because two things move together that does not mean that one thing is causing the other thing. We’ve discussed examples of this before. So, the question that (at least for me) itched in the back of my mind was “Okay. Well, what <em>is</em> causality then? What does it mean for a thing to cause another thing?”</p>
<p>Our final few chapters cover treatment effects/causal inference for policy analysis. Strictly speaking, we could have multiple courses on this. So, as an introduction, this chapter seeks to provide you with the basic philosophy of causal inference, specifically, what it is as a concept, how it’s used in the policy sciences. We will cover randomization, as well as threats to validity in the context of impact evaluation.</p>
<section id="what-is-causality" class="level2" data-number="7.1">
<h2 data-number="7.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-causality"><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> What Is Causality?</h2>
<p>As I <a href="https://jgreathouse9.github.io/GSUmetricspolicy/correlation.html">mentioned</a> in the chapter on correlation, humans have <em>evolved</em> to think hypothetically. It is how we have survived for as long as we have. Causal inference demands that we imagine another world that we believe could exist, but doesn’t exist.</p>
<div id="def-cf" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 7.1 (Counterfactual) </strong></span>A counterfactual is defined as the quantitative difference between what we really see for one outcome, and what we <em>would have</em> seen if some intervention didn’t take place.</p>
</div>
<p>In history, we’d call this a “counterfactual”, so termed because we are talking about a fictional scenario that happened <em>in contrast</em> to observed facts. We as human beings do this all the time.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How would the American economy have evolved post 1860 if the Civil War never happened?</p></li>
<li><p>What if a school did a new math curriculum? Would math scores improve?</p></li>
<li><p>How would gun homicide statistics look, 6 months from now, if a state <em>didn’t</em> pass gun control policies?</p></li>
<li><p>How would a grocery store’s in-store sales have evolved if it didn’t implement all self checkout scanners?</p></li>
<li><p>Did Nebraska’s repeal of the tampon tax affect tampon use? How would tampon sales have evolved if Nebraska didn’t get rid of the tax?</p></li>
<li><p>How would New Orleans’ outward migration have looked if Hurricane Katrina didn’t happen?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A counterfactual is byproduct of what we call a <em>treatment effect</em>, or the actual quantitative impact of the treatment.</p>
<div id="def-tau" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 7.2 (Treatment Effect) </strong></span>Mathematically, we can represent the treatment effect like \(\tau_{i} = y_{i}^{1} - y_{i}^{0}\), where the <span class="math inline">\(y_{i}^{1}\)</span> denotes an outcome we observe (the unit under treatment) versus the outcome <span class="math inline">\(y_{i}^{0}\)</span>, which we do not observe (the untreated values). Note that the Greek letter “t-ow” is used as a symbol for the treatment effect, yet you may use other symbols in your writing should you wish.</p>
</div>
<p>However, we get but one copy of reality. The American Civil War ended in 1865. The real GDP of the U.S. in 1866 was roughly 88.8 billion dollars (in today’s money). So, the formula for the treatment effect is \(\tau_{i} = y_{i}^{1} - ?\). Why is there a question mark here? Well, we can’t literally look at the United States where the Civil War happened (the reality we have) and one where it didn’t happen (not that we’d really want to, by the way). It’s impossible to access that reality in the current universe we exist in. Thus, counterfactuals are things we can estimate, guess about, and speculate on, but never ever see in real life. Before we get into how we’d estimate counterfactuals statistically, though, let’s use a more relatable example.</p>
<p>Suppose I’m going to school today. I think the way I take to school (Way A) is quicker than Way B. This gives us a set of two ways to take, \(d \in \{0,1\}\) (read as “d in 0 1”), where \(d=0\) means we’ve taken Way B and \(d=1\) means we’ve taken Way A. The outcome of interest \(y\) is the commute time associated with each way we take.</p>
<p>Each way we take, expressed formally as \(d \mapsto y\left(d\right)\), or our commute time being a function of the road we choose. We may represent the outcomes of each way as \(y^A\) and \(y^B\), where naturally \(y^A\) is how long it takes if we take my way and \(y^B\) is how long it takes if we go the other way.</p>
<p>Here, our \(\tau\) is the difference in minutes between the way it took me by taking Way A, and the time it <em>would’ve</em> taken me if I’d taken Way B. In fact, I did this as I wrote this. I used Google Maps to tell me how long the drive from my apartment to Georgia Tech would be. Using the highway it takes 14 minutes. But, one of the options when I avoid highways takes 23 minutes.</p>
<table class="table">

</tbody>
</table>
<p>To do this in Stata, let’s get this exact same effect size with regression, using the model <span class="math inline">\(y=\beta_0+\beta_1x_i\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is our commute time, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> is the constant (or the time we would expect to take if we’d taken Way B), <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> is the effect of taking Way A, and <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> is the value for having taken Way A, relative to Way B.</p>
<p>If you’ve been paying attention, you rememeber from last time that the way we interpret the OLS coefficients/betas/estimates for a continuous variable is “a one unit increase in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> leads to a <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> change in <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, compared to other units”. In the case of a <em>dichotomous variable</em> however (such as taking the Highway A), we interpret the <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> as a <em>difference</em> between Way A and B.</p>

<p>See how this returns the same coefficient as above? The way we interpret the <code>taken</code> coefficient is that the expected commute time when taking Way A is 9 minutes less than what we’d expect had I taken Way B. Similarly, it tells us that not taking Way A (or, if <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span>), we travel 23 minutes.</p>

<p>Suppose I do indeed take Way A, as I would, and that it in fact takes 14 minutes. Does this mean the effect of Way A is in general quicker by 9 minutes? No, not exactly. Maybe I do take \(y^A\), but traffic builds on Way A, but traffic does not build up on the other way. Or, maybe \(y^A\) still would take 14 minutes, but the other way, \(y^B\), happens to (this time) take 20 minutes instead of 23, meaning our treatment effect is now \(14-20=-6\). The problem inherent here is I cannot take both ways at once. I have a choice to make, and once I choose I must commmit to it. I can <em>either</em> take my way or the other way, I can’t do both on the same day at the same time. Thus, because of this choice, I can only guess as to what \(y^B\)’s travel time actually would have been for me on that day. Only one outcome exists in reality.</p>

<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 7.3 (Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference) </strong></span>The fundamental problem of causal inference is that we observe units as treated or untreated: <span class="math inline">\(y_{i}=dy_{i}^{1}+\left(1-d \right)y_{i}^0\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s break down the equation from <a href="#def-seq">Definition&nbsp;<span>7.3</span></a>. If we take Way A (<span class="math inline">\(d=1\)</span>), we get \(y=y^A \times 1 +\left(1-1\right)y^B\), or just \(y^A\) since anything multiplied by 0 is just 0 and \(y^A \times 1\) is just \(y^A\). If we take Way B (<span class="math inline">\(d=0\)</span>), we get \(y=y^A \times 0 +\left(1-0\right)y^B\), or just \(y^B\) because now \(y^A \times 0=0\) and \(\left(1-0\right)y^B\) is just \(1 \times y^B\).</p>
<p>The same issues apply to this highway example though. The 9 minute effect size is but an estimate of an imperfectly accounted for reality. The counterfactual is <em>inherently</em> unobservable because the treatment effect is unobservable. The counterfactual, and therefore the treatment effect, are both things we have to estimate.</p>

<h2 data-number="7.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="randomized-controlled-trials"><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Randomized Controlled Trials</h2>
<p>Establishing causality and generating counterfactuals are all about comparisons. Typically, we compare a group of one or more units that did an intervention or policy to units that did not do the same policy. We use regression as a vehicle to facilitate this comparison. Before we do this for a real policy example though, let’s think about how this is done in a (close to) ideal setting.</p>
<div id="def-rct" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 7.4 (Randomized Controlled Trial) </strong></span>A randomized controlled trial is a form of study design where we assign a treatment at random to a certain number of people or units or entities. In such a design, random assignment means every unit should have a 0.5 probability of recieving the treatment.</p>
</div>
<p>In medicine, we must test drugs in order to see if they work before we allow them to be used on humans in a broader sense. We use randomized controlled trials to try to establish the efficacy of drugs. In this case, the individual is the unit of interest. There are <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> such individuals. Those who get the treatment we call the <em>treatment group</em> with their number being <span class="math inline">\(N_{\text{tr}}\)</span>. Those who do not get the treatment are called the <em>control group</em> (or, sometimes we call the untreated group the <em>donor pool</em>), with their number being <span class="math inline">\(N-N_{\text{tr}}\)</span>. We randomize treatments by using a computer to flip a coin across our \(N\) individuals/units to determine if it gets treatment. If treatment assignment is truly random, this now means that any <em>other</em> covariates that may influence the outcome do not predict treatment status or outcome information. We call these additional covariates that that cloud the relationship between the treatment and the outcome <strong>confounders</strong>.</p>
<p>Say we wish to study the impact of a vaccine on recovery time. We cannot just give the vaccine to some people and not others in a non-random way because maybe other variables may confound the relationship between the recovery rates and treatment assignment. Perhaps those who took the vaccine are younger on average than those who didn’t. Or, maybe they had bettter baseline health characteristics. This means, on average, those who took the vaccine would recover from COVID (say) quicker than the control group, not completely because of the vaccine but because they were already healthier or younger on average compared to the control group. Alternatively, maybe there are just unobserved factors we can’t see which explain why the treatment group did better, to a degree.</p>
<div id="exm-rct" class="theorem example">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Example 7.1 (Vaccine) </strong></span>When the coin flip decides who gets the vaccine, then in a large enough representative sample, our treatment and control groups are <em>balanced</em> across all confounders, on average. We say “balanced” because when all study participants of all ages, races, and so on are <strong>equally likely</strong> to be given the vaccine or not, the average difference in recovery time can be better attributed to the vaccine instead of other factors such as age.</p>
</div>
<p>After we’ve randomized our treatment successfully, we can then calculate what the effect size is. In the case of a randomized controlled trial, the estimand of interest is the average treatment effect.</p>
<div id="def-ate" class="theorem definition">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Definition 7.5 (Average Treatment Effect) </strong></span>We may compute the average treatment effect as <span class="math inline">\(\text{ATE}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}y_i^1-y_i^0\)</span>. This is only valid when the treatment is randomized.</p>
</div>
<p>We can estimate the ATE using regression in Stata.</p>

<h2 data-number="7.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="problems-with-randomization"><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Problems With Randomization</h2>
<p>The central issue with randomization is that there are some interventions (in fact, most of them) that researchers simply cannot randomize. After all, many treatments of interest have explicit assignment mechanisims (i.e., this neighborhood has high crime rates <em>therefore</em> we elect to send more police as a response to crime). Even if the rationale for doing the treatment is not given, sometimes our available set of control units may differ in important ways from the unit that’s treated.</p>
<div id="exm-turk" class="theorem example">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Example 7.2 (Turkey) </strong></span>In February of 2023, Turkey had an earthquake. Suppose we’re interested in the effect of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/earthquake-turkey-syria-february-2023-62dba95d0608a3a587ddd2fe5ec39541">this earthquake</a> on the local economic outcomes for the affected cities or the entire country. Well, researchers cannot randomize earthquakes to strike certain cities versus others, and even if we could this would be morally unacceptable. So assuming we were comparing cities in Turkey that were affected to those that weren’t, the affected areas may differ in their baseline characteristics from unaffected areas. For example, <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/02/16/poor-areas-suffered-35-times-more-damage-in-turkeys-earthquake">maybe poorer areas</a> were more vulnerable than richer ones. For a cross country comparison, maybe <a href="https://archinect.com/news/article/150422767/strict-building-codes-prevented-a-larger-catastrophe-in-earthquake-prone-taiwan">bulding codes</a> would explain the differences in the effect of the earthquake which, in turn, affect the economic implications for Turkey versus another unexposed nation.</p>
</div>
<div id="exm-weed" class="theorem example">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Example 7.3 (Weed) </strong></span>Another example is cannabis legalization. We cannot flip coins to have some states legalize cannabis and others not. Canabis’ legality is decided by the preferences of the legislature. Thus, we run into the problem of selection bias (as in, maybe some states are more likely to legealize cannabis than others). We also run into counfounding biases. If we wish to see how legal cannabis affected alcohol sales for Oregon, then we need to consider what other factors may affect alcohol consumption aside from the policy of interest. That is, Oregon may differ from other states (say, Alabama or Mississippi) on key characteristics that makes the causal comparison unreasonable. Maybe the price of alcohol between Oregon and a set of others states was not similar enough. Maybe Oregon simply had different economic conditions that made alcohol consumption more or less likely. Perhaps cultural factors would lead to higher level of alcohol consumption anyways, absent cannabis legalization. The fact that we cannot randomize means that researchers cannot make plausible the unconfoundedness assumption (or, lack of omitted variable bias) which underlies OLS regression models.</p>

<h2 data-number="7.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="threats-to-validity"><span class="header-section-number">7.4</span> Threats to Validity</h2>
<p>Of course, the subject of the next chapter will be how to properly address for lack of randomization. For now though, we cover the kinds of <a href="https://www.creative-wisdom.com/teaching/WBI/threat.shtml">threats to validity</a> of causal estimates, some of which will be quite helpful in characterizing the plausibility of causal estimates.</p>
<section id="internal-validity" class="level3" data-number="7.4.1">
<h3 data-number="7.4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="internal-validity"><span class="header-section-number">7.4.1</span> Internal Validity</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>History</strong>: Bias occurs when external events influence the outcome in some way. Example? Holidays. Suppose we are a grocery store and we wish to see if the introduction of some new product will increase sales. Suppose for the moment that this is a new chocolate bar If we introduce the chocolate bar this week, and Valentine’s Day is next week, we can’t really attribute the growth of rose sales to the chocolate bar, even though roses and chocolate are complimentary goods in many cases. Why not? It’s Valentine’s Day! People are more likely to buy things in general that day and in the days leading up to it, we couldn’t attribute the effect of the chocolate bar to sales unless we do additional adjustments to our sales estimates. Another example was <a href="https://x.com/Travis_4_Trump/status/1831372457372217386">this one</a> I mentioned from the correlation chapter, where the historical bias that leads to rise of more school shootings has to do with the fact that schools just opened, and therefore could not have had school shootings when they were not open.</li>
<li><strong>Maturation</strong>: Natural changes in participants over time that affect outcomes independent of the treatment. For example, suppose we wish to see if the new chocolate bar has weed in it, and we wish to see if the weed and chocolate affected sales in the following 6 months after its introduction. We’d need to be sure that the treated unit, relative to its comparison units, has the same internal composition. In other words, what if over the next 6 months the area continues to gentrify further, bringing in people with higher incomes. Maybe, spending at the store would’ve increased anyhow, independent of a new product.</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong>: The effect of giving a treatment more than once. Not really relevant for policy scientists unless you’re doing a true experiment with humans, but perhaps repeated tests mean people get wise to the format of the test such that the outcomes are no lnoger being meaningfully tested.</li>
<li><strong>Instrumentation</strong>: Changes in the the way we measure the outcome over time. This is pretty common, in fact. Actually, instrumentation has even been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN1eptTaWVM">advocated for</a> in the context of COVID-19 policy. If the CDC is testing COVID cases one way, and then they either stop testing or make important chagnes to how they test, this may invalidate the estimated causal effect of some policy because it may make it look like the policy was much more/less effective than it in fact was. The more consistent your outcomes are collected, the better off your estiamtes will be.</li>
<li><strong>Statistical Regression</strong>: Extreme results tend to revert back to the average trend over time. Suppose <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/haitian-immigrants-fueled-springfields-growth-now-us-presidential-debate-2024-09-11/">we say</a> Haitian immigrants are the cause of increases in welfare or car accidents. Perhaps this is so, but presumbly (due to maturation over time), new residents will get jobs and adjust more into the community (i.e., having more driver’s licenses). So, while there may be a spike in some outcome after an intervention, it is likely that the outcome may return to trend, especially for short lived shocks that aren’t expected to have very long term effects.</li>
<li><strong>Selection</strong>: Baseline differences between treated and untreated units which make their outcomes incomparable. The classic example in economics is the benefits of education on income. People who get PHDs and numerous advanced degrees likely differ substantially from the rest of the population who do not. Maybe they, on average, come from wealthier families or are dissimarly situated compared to those who don’t go to college. In other words, maybe people get education on the grounds that they will make more money as a result; or maybe such people are more motivated in a sense, and would’ve made more money anyways without the education.</li>
<li><strong>Experimental Mortality (Attrition)</strong>: Participants leave the study over time. Say a grocery store goes all self checkout on grounds that it’ll make more money. We compare one grocery store to 50 others, and of those 50, say 20 close over the 6 month study period. Well, unless we attenuate for this, it is likely the case that a store that is doing experimental things, from a corporate perspective, is already “built different” from the ones who closed. So, keeping the stores in the sample who all closed likely differ from the treated unit.</li>
<li><strong>Selection-Maturation Interaction</strong>: When different groups mature differently, this leads to heterogeneous trends that makes it tough to estimate the treatment effect. I mentioned gentrification above; what if one city, or a cluster of them, mature at much different rates compared to the treated units. There may be reasons for this differnece in maturation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Satisfying these may not always be relevant for every study (for example, if all your units remain in the study, you do not need to care about attrition.)</p>
</section>
<section id="threats-to-external-validity" class="level3" data-number="7.4.2">
<h3 data-number="7.4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="threats-to-external-validity"><span class="header-section-number">7.4.2</span> Threats to External Validity</h3>
<p>These are threats that compromise the generalizability of the study’s findings.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Interaction of Testing and Treatment</strong>: The act of testing may change participants’ responses. not really relevant for many public policy settigns where we typically study macro-level interventions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interaction of Selection and Treatment</strong>: If the treatment effects are unit specific, we cannot generalize about them. If we wish to see a NBA training program affected basketball skills, we cannot include normal people in the control group since NBA players will smoke any normal human being. Their baseline differences are so gigantic that the effect of the program would be wildly overstated.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multiple-Treatment Interference</strong>: Multiple treatments harm our ability to isolate the impact of one single treatment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As above, satisfying these external threats to validity may not be necessary in every study, since each treatment is unique. If only one intervention occurs (which we may have to verify in some cases), we don’t have to worry about interfernece of treatments.</p>

<p>Unlike the OLS chapter which was very math intensive, this chapter is likely the most conceptually heavy. Thinking in a causal manner requires practice. It is not simply a scientific tool, it is a framework with which we can use to evaluate the world through. It forces us to step back and consider, step by step, the methods and mechanisms which policy affects things through. If you do this for long enough, you’ll even hear causal claims like “This politician reduced crime”</p>
