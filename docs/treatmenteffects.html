<p>Statistics teachers oftentimes proudly declare to their students that correlation is not causation when emphasizing the idea that just because two things move together that doesn’t mean that one thing is causing the other thing. We’ve discussed examples of this before. So, the question that (at least for me) itched in the back of my mind was “Okay. Well, what <em>is</em> causality then? What does it mean for a thing to cause another thing?”</p>
<p>Our final chapter covers treatment effects/causal inference for policy analysis. Strictly speaking, we could have multiple courses on this. So, as an introduction, this chapter seeks to provide you with the basic philosophy of causal inference, specifically, what it is as a concept, how it’s used in the policy sciences, and how we may use regression to implement basic causal designs for research.</p>

<p>In this chapter, I (in addition to the basic philosophy of causality) introduce one of the basic causal inference methods in econometrics and public policy: the difference-in-differences design. It is designed specifically for impact analysis (that is, how one policy affected some specific outcome). Even though it is the last thing we cover, it is <em>not</em> a requirement for your final papers. You may use normal regression to study mere associations if you so choose.</p>

<h2 data-number="7.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-causality"><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> What Is Causality?</h2>
<p>As I <a href="https://jgreathouse9.github.io/GSUmetricspolicy/correlation.html">mentioned</a> in the chapter on correlation, humans have <em>evolved</em> to think hypothetically. It is how we have survived for as long as we have. Causal inference demands that we imagine another world that we believe could exist, but doesn’t exist. In history, we’d call this a “counterfactual”, so termed because we are talking about a scenario that happened in contrast to observed facts. We as human beings do this all the time.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What if the North lost the American Civil War? How would the American economy have evolved post 1865 if this happened?</p></li>
<li><p>What if a school kept the same math curriculum instead of implementing a new one?</p></li>
<li><p>How would gun homicide statistics look if a state <em>didn’t</em> pass gun control policies?</p></li>
<li><p>How would Hawaii’s economy have evolved were it never colonized?</p></li>
<li><p>How would New Orleans’ economy have looked if Hurricane Katrina didn’t happen?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I keep phrasing it as “what if” because that’s exactly what it is. A counterfactual, at its heart, is the way a metric, outcome, or construct <em>would have</em> looked in a world where what did happen, did not happen. Thus, a counterfactual is something we can estimate, guess about, and speculate on, but never see in real life. Before we get into how we’d estimate counterfactuals statistically, though, let’s use a more relatable example.</p>
<p>Suppose I’m going to school today. I think the way I take to school (Way A) is quicker than Way B. This gives us a set of two ways to take, <span class="math inline">\(d \in \{0,1\}\)</span> (read as “d in 0 1”), where <span class="math inline">\(d=0\)</span> means we’ve taken Way B and <span class="math inline">\(d=1\)</span> means we’ve taken Way A. Each way we take, of course, is connected to a set of outcomes. The outcomes are just the time that it takes to get to the destination. We may represent the outcomes of each way as <span class="math inline">\(y^A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y^B\)</span>, where naturally <span class="math inline">\(y^A\)</span> is how long it takes if we take my way and <span class="math inline">\(y^B\)</span> is how long it takes if we go the other way. The “treatment effect” of Way A is <span class="math inline">\(\tau = y^A - y^B\)</span>. Here, <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> (the Greek letter “t-ow”) is the difference in minutes between the way it took me by taking my way, and the time it <em>would’ve</em> taken me if I’d taken Way B. In fact, I did this as I wrote this. I used Google Maps to tell me how long the drive from my apartment to Georgia Tech would be. Using the highway it takes 14 minutes. But, one of the options when I avoid highways takes 23 minutes.</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Way Taken</th>
<th>Indicator <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span></th>
<th>Commute Time</th>
<th>Outcome <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Way A</td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(d=1\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(y^A = 14\)</span> min</td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(y = y^A = 14\)</span> min</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Way B</td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(d=0\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(y^B = 23\)</span> min</td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(y = y^B = 23\)</span> min</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Treatment Effect</td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(y^A - y^B = -9\)</span> min</td>
<td>N/A</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Suppose I do indeed take Way A, as I would, and that it in fact takes 14 minutes. Does this mean the effect of Way A is -9, or, my way being quicker by 9 minutes? No, not exactly. Maybe I do take <span class="math inline">\(y^A\)</span>, but traffic builds and it doesn’t on the other way. Or, maybe <span class="math inline">\(y^A\)</span> still would take 14 minutes, but the other way, <span class="math inline">\(y^B\)</span>, happens to take 20 minutes instead of 23, meaning our treatment effect is now <span class="math inline">\(14-20=-6\)</span>. The problem inherent here is I cannot take both ways at once. I have a choice to make, and once I choose I must commmit to it. I can <em>either</em> take my way or the other way, I can’t do both on the same day at the same time. Thus, because of this choice, I can only guess as to what <span class="math inline">\(y^B\)</span>’s travel time actually would have been for me on that day. Only one outcome exists in reality. Mathematically, we may represent this as <span class="math inline">\(y=dy^{A}+\left(1-d\right)y^B\)</span>. If we take Way A, we get <span class="math inline">\(y=y^A \times 1 +\left(1-1\right)y^B\)</span>, or just <span class="math inline">\(y^A\)</span> since anything multiplied by 0 is just 0 and <span class="math inline">\(y^A \times 1\)</span> is just <span class="math inline">\(y^A\)</span>. If we take Way B, we get <span class="math inline">\(y=y^A \times 0 +\left(1-0\right)y^B\)</span>, or just <span class="math inline">\(y^B\)</span> because now <span class="math inline">\(y^A \times 0=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left(1-0\right)y^B\)</span> is just <span class="math inline">\(1 \times y^B\)</span>. This means that the counterfactual is <em>inherently</em> unobservable. Short of time machines where we can peer into alternate universes, the counterfactual is something we have to estimate. Counterfactuals are all about comparisons, where we compare a group of units that did an intervention or policy to units that did not do this. We use regression as a vehicle to facilitate this comparison. Before we do this for a real policy example though, let’s think about how this is done in an ideal setting.</p>

<section id="randomized-controlled-trials" class="level2" data-number="7.2">
<h2 data-number="7.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="randomized-controlled-trials"><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Randomized Controlled Trials</h2>
<p>In medicine, we use randomized controlled trials to test drugs. What is a randomzied controlled trial? It is a form of study design where we, as the reasearchers, assign a treatment, at random, to a certain number of people or units or entities. Those who get the treatment we call the <em>treatment group</em>, those who do not get it are called the <em>control group</em> (or, sometimes we call the untreated group the <em>donor pool</em>). When we say “random assignment”, we mean that we assign the treatment such that each person has an equal probability of getting the treatment. If the treatment assignment is truly random, this now means that any <em>other</em> covariates that may influence the outcome do not predict treatment status or outcome information.</p>
<p>Say we wish to study the impact of a vaccine on recovery time. We cannot just give the vaccine to some people and not others in a non-random way because maybe other variables are influencing recovery rates. Perhaps those who took the vaccine are younger on average than those who didn’t. Or, maybe they had bettter baseline health characteristics. This means, on average, those who took the vaccine would recover from COVID (say) quicker than the control group, not completely because of the vaccine but because they were already healthier or younger on average compared to the control group. We’d say something is wrong if they <em>didn’t</em> recover quicker. Alternatively, maybe there are just unobserved factors we can’t see which explain why the treatment group did better, to a degree. However, when the coin flip decides who gets the vaccine, then in a large enough representative sample, our treatment and control groups would be <em>balanced</em>, on average. Then, everybody, of all ages, races, and so on is equally as likely to be given the vaccine or not. Thus, the difference in recovery time can be better attributed to the vaccine instead of other factors. If our treatment and control groups are balanced, or that they have very similar baseline characterictics, we may compute the treatment effect as <span class="math inline">\(\text{ATE}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}y_i^1-y_i^0\)</span>, or the raw, average differences of the outcomes between the treatment group and control group, where <span class="math inline">\(y_i^1\)</span> is the outcomes for all of our treted units (recovery time, in this case) and <span class="math inline">\(y_i^0\)</span> represents the outcomes for all those in the control group.</p>
<p>To illustrate the idea of balance in a public policy setting, I generate synthetic data on 100 individuals who, at their job, enter some program which may increase income. Individuals are aged from 18 to 50. However, age may correlate with income. Older people tend to have more work or professional experience than younger people, on average. So, simply comparing their outcomes versus a younger group may be bad statistical practice. I iteratively assign some probability of treatment to all of them from <span class="math inline">\(0.05 \leq p \leq 0.5\)</span> in increments of 0.01. We can see, from the GIF below, that when the probability of being treated is <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span>, the differences across both age and pre-existing incomes vanishes. The control group is on averge a year older than the treatment group, and the income difference between them vanishes to an absolute difference of 54 dollars, where the treatment group makes more than the people who didn’t do the jobs program. So now that we’ve randomized, we can have people take the program and see how it affects their incomes.</p>

<h2 data-number="7.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="problems-with-randomization"><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Problems With Randomization</h2>
<p>The central issue with randomization is that there are some interventions (in fact, most of them) that researchers simply cannot randomize. After all, many treatments of interest have explicit assignment mechanisims (i.e., this neighborhood has high crime rates <em>therefore</em> we sent more police as a response to crime). Even if the rationale for doing the treatment is not given, sometimes our available set of control units may differ in important ways from the unit that’s treated.</p>
<p>Suppose we’re interested in the effect of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/earthquake-turkey-syria-february-2023-62dba95d0608a3a587ddd2fe5ec39541">an earthquake</a> on the local economic outcomes for a city or country. Well, researchers cannot randomize earthquakes to strike certain cities versus others, and even if we could this would be morally unacceptable. So assuming we were comparing cities in Turkey that were affected to those that weren’t, the affected areas may differ in their baseline characteristics from unaffected areas. For example, <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/02/16/poor-areas-suffered-35-times-more-damage-in-turkeys-earthquake">maybe poorer areas</a> were more vulnerable than richer ones. We cannot (and should not) randomize mini-earthquakes to happen in some cities versus others. Suppose we were comparing Turkey to other nations. Maybe <a href="https://archinect.com/news/article/150422767/strict-building-codes-prevented-a-larger-catastrophe-in-earthquake-prone-taiwan">bulding codes</a> would explain the differences in the effect of the earthquake which, in turn, affect the economic implications for Turkey versus another unexposed nation.</p>
<p>Another example is cannabis legalization. We cannot flip coins to have some states legalize cannabis and others not. Those are decided by the legislature. Additionally, we still run into the problem of confounding. Oregon legalized cannabis in 2014. If we wish to see how legal cannabis affected alcohol sales for Oregon, then we need to consider what factors may affect alcohol consumption and the likelihood of cannabis being consumed. That is, Oregon may differ from other states (say, Alabama or Mississippi) in relevant ways that make their alcohol consumption trends before cannabis legalization not comparable. Maybe the price of alcohol between Oregon and a set of others states was not similar enough. Maybe they had different economic conditions that made alcohol consumption more or less likely. Perhaps cultural factors would lead to higher level of alcohol consumption. The fact that we cannot randomize these interventions means that researchers cannot make plausible the unconfoundedness assumption (or, lack of omitted variable bias) which underlies OLS regression models.</p>

<p>Even though we cannot randomize all treatments/policies, does this mean that we cannot do policy analysis at all? No.&nbsp;Modern econometrics has developed a slew of methods for doing policy analysis when the intervention of interest simply cannot be subject to a controlled expriment.</p>
